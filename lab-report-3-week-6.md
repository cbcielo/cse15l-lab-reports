# Lab Report 3, Week 6
Hello! This weeks lab report focuses on improving work efficiency though:
* streamlining ssh configuration
* setting up Github access through ieng6
* copying full directories using the scp -r shortcut to a remote server

Let's get started!

## StreamLining ssh Configuration

* show .ssh/config file and how you edited it with vscode
* show ssh command log in using just the alias you chose
* show an scp command copying the file to your account using the alias you chose

## Setting Up Github Access Through ieng6

* ishow where the public key you made is stored on Github and in your user account (screenshot)
* show where the private key you made is stored on your user acccount but not its contents (screenshot)
* show running git commands to commit/push a change to Github while logged into ieng6 account
* show link for resukting commit 

## Copy Directory Using "scp -r"

* show copying whole markdown parse directory to ieng account
* show logging into ieng6 account after this and compiling/running tests for repository 
* show (like in last step of first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line
